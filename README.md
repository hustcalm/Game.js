## Introduction
A simple but powerful JavaScript framework for creating 2D games with JavaScript and the Canvas element.

**The Framework** itself will reside in the "framework" directory as a very base for developers.

**The Demos** will reside in the "demos" directory with their own individual sub-directory, also you can get the **original demos** at [Sourceforge](http://webdemos.sourceforge.net/) and [Source Code](http://sourceforge.net/projects/webdemos/?source=navbar).

## Useful Resources
[BRIGHT HUB](http://www.brighthub.com) is great!

To begin learn about web development, I strongly recommend the articles [here](www.brighthub.com/internet/web-development.aspx).

To start with JavaScript, follow [this](http://www.brighthub.com/internet/web-development/topics/javascript-help.aspx).

## Todo
* Enhancement to the framework itself ( but still focus on 2D games)
* Translate the series into Chinese and post at [My Blog](http://www.hustcalm.me)
* Anything that will come up...
